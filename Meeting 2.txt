3. Agenda Overview
We discussed how we were going to tackle this project and if we were going to use asana or github for our project board. We also assigned different issue and who was going to tackle what section of the project

Topic 1: Asana vs Github for project board
Key Points Discussed:
Asana felt more personable to use
Asana is industry adopted and has alot of write up on how to use asana
The project says to use Github projects but we still dont know if we can use asana
Decisions Made: Asana will be used if signed off by the TA
